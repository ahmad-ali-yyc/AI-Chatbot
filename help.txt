// Prerequisites
Ensure Python and Pip are installed.  
Check in CMD: python --version
              pip --version
Memory required: ~15GB and Recommened RAM: 16GB 

// Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all necessary packages:
    pip install fastapi uvicorn transformers torch datasets
// Save Code
Save the following Python scripts in the same directory:
    - app.py
    - training_ai.py
    - initializeDB.py
    - process_images.py

//Other files and folders needed
Save all the images in folder ALL_IMAGES for ai to process
Save the contact in contacts.txt to allow ai to know people she is texting. 
Save the Qna file in same directory "Alexandra Questions.txt"

// Set Up Database and Train AI
1 Initialize the database:
    python initializeDB.py
2 Process images (stores categorized images in DB)
    python process_images.py
3 Train the AI:
    python training_ai.py

// Run the App
Navigate to the directory where `app.py` is located and run:
    uvicorn app:app --reload

The app will start at:  
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat

// Open Postman for Testing
- Set URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat`
- Select: **POST**  
- Go to **Body -> Raw -> JSON**  
- Enter the following:
```json
{
    "message": "Hey, send me something cute!"
}

//Notes
Right now the code expects all images to be in the same directory as the code under folder ALL_IMAGES, if you want to process images per phase that can be done as well.
